# RL Face Grid Navigation for Facial Landmarks

This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that navigates a 2D grid representing a face and locates facial landmarks (eyes, nose, etc.) using Q-learning.

## Features
- Q-learning agent for grid grid navigation
- Custom environment (no external RL libraries required)
- Interactive Streamlit UI to visualize learning curve and agent path
